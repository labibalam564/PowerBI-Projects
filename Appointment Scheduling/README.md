# Appointment Scheduling
This Power BI dashboard was created using data obtain from Kaggle provided via a CSV file. The data file will
be available in the repository. This dataset consists of clients, their healthcare providers at this clinic, the
date they requested an appointment, and their appointment date. The purpose of this dashboard is to identify the
wait times for patients to see their healthcare providers based on the healthcare provider role. If any trends are
identified, it can be escalated to those providers in an effort to reduce wait times for patients.

Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, I cleaned some of the data that was missing and reformatted the data in the 
Requesting Date and Appointment Date columns as they were in a string format.

Once in Power BI, I used Power Query Editor to extract the data from the CSV file and perform some transformations
before loading the data into Power BI. I used DAX to create custom measures and calculated columns that 
would later be visualized in the report. I then created the visuals and filters to complete the dashboard.

For those without access to Power BI, a screenshot of the dashboard will be available for viewing.
